## Introduction
At M1C2, we believe that art and product development are not mutually exclusive. Our studio practice is guided by a set of core tenets that emphasize iteration, resilience, and innovation. We aim to create works that resonate with the cultural organism and contribute to the collective knowledge.

## Tenets
Our practice is built on the following principles:

1. **Art is an Iterative Process**
2. **Test in Production**
3. **Art Market Fit**
4. **Agile Artistry**
5. **Measure Once**
6. **Cut Twice**
7. **Public Iteration**
8. **Speed (a need)**
9. **Open Source Innovation**

## Projects
Coming soon.
