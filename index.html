    <p>"Tenets" for "my" studio practice – is art and product really that different? – things I care about for some reason or another</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Perfection is the enemy of <strong>Progress</strong></li>
                <li>be resilient, adaptive, responsive to the work in the lived environment</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Art Market Fit
            <ul>
                <li>"cultural lightning" art is art that has found PMF</li>
                <li>seek <em>resonance</em> with the organism that is culture</li>

        <li>Agile Artistry
            <ul>
                <li>reduce creative projects into manageable iterative cycles</li>
                <li>to be responsive, flexible, innovative without reducing <strong>output velocity</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Measure Once
            <ul>
                <li>strategic vision + thoughtful planning precedes execution</li>
                <li>set a clear + deliberate direction, ensuring each step is purposeful + informed or informing (toward being informed)</li>

                <li>commit to bold, decisive actions</li>
                <li>there will be missteps, be willing to "cut again", learning + adapting continuously</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Public Iteration
            <ul>
                <li>Transparency in Process + Output is crucial to finding <em>resonance</em> (necessary for 3).</li>
                <li>through precise measurement one can derive the resonance of a room, or it can be discovered directly just by singing (preferred)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Speed (a need)
            <ul>
                <li>speed is not just about "moving fast" but maintaining momentum</li>
                <li>trend-casting, trend-tracing, trend-setting, trend-mapping are all opportunities in <strong>Alpha</strong></li>
                <li>information asymmetric opportunities are seized by those who move fast</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
