        <h1>Reflections on Signatures</h1>
        <p>
            In retrospect it seems clear that we lost something essential on the way to this particular moment - 
            that nebulous quality of knowing, truly knowing, what is real. The morning I first saw my own face 
            speaking words I had never said, I understood that we had entered a time of necessary redefinition. 
            The video was perfect: my mannerisms, the slight tilt of my head, that California drawl I never quite 
            shed. Only it wasn't me. It was a simulation, a ghost in the machine, speaking with my borrowed authority.

            The term "digital sovereignty" appeared in my notes again and again during those months, though its 
            meaning remained elusive. We threw around phrases like "cryptographic verification" and "authentication 
            protocols," as if technical solutions could shore up the collapsing boundaries between truth and 
            fabrication. In a sense, they can. Digital signatures provide a mathematical certainty: this is mine, 
            this is not, this happened, this did not. But the necessity for such proof reveals a deeper anxiety 
            about our place in this new world.

            What haunts me is not the technology itself but what it tells us about myself, about what we will imminently 
            become. A society that requires mathematical proof of human identity is a society that has lost 
            something fundamental. I believe that digital signatures are the only answer - that by signing my 
            creations, my statements, my very presence in the digital, I can maintain some control over 
            my narratives. Perhaps. But what I am really signing is a social contract, one that acknowledges 
            that truth now requires proof, that identity must be mathematically verified, that my word alone is 
            no longer enough. The irony does not escape me: that in an age where machines can create anything, 
            the most human thing we can do is sign our names.
